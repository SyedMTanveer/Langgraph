        "## Context\n",
        "\n",
        "At LangChain, we aim to make it easy to build LLM applications. One type of LLM application you can build is an agent. There’s a lot of excitement around building agents because they can automate a wide range of tasks that were previously impossible.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice though, it is incredibly difficult to build systems that reliably execute on these tasks. As we’ve worked with our users to put agents into production, we’ve learned that more control is often necessary. You might need an agent to always call a specific tool first or use different prompts based on its state.\n",
        "\n",
        "To tackle this problem, we’ve built [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) — a framework for building agent and multi-agent applications. Separate from the LangChain package, LangGraph’s core design philosophy is to help developers add better precision and control into agent workflows, suitable for the complexity of real-world systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Course Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "The course is structured as a set of modules, with each module focused on a particular theme related to LangGraph. You will see a folder for each module, which contains a series of notebooks. A video will accompany each notebook to help walk through the concepts, but the notebooks are also stand-alone, meaning that they contain explanations and can be viewed independent of the videos. Each module folder also contains a `studio` folder, which contains a set of graphs that can be loaded into [LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio), our IDE for building LangGraph applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you begin, please follow the instructions in the `README` to create an environment and install dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Chat models\n",
        "\n",
        "In this course, we'll be using [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#chat-models), which do a few things take a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs. LangChain does not host any Chat Models, rather we rely on third party integrations. [Here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/chat/) is a list of 3rd party chat model integrations within LangChain! By default, the course with use [GEMINI_API_KEY](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key/) because it is both popular and performant. As noted, please ensure that you have an `GEMINI_API_KEY`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's check that your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set and, if not, you will be asked to enter it."

Official Documentation:** The best place to start is the official LangChain documentation.  It\\'s well-structured and provides comprehensive tutorials and examples.  Look for their \"Getting Started\" guides and work your way through the examples.\\n\\n**2. Tutorials and Blog Posts:** Many tutorials and blog posts are available online that cover various aspects of LangChain. Search for \"LangChain tutorial\" or \"LangChain examples\" on Google, YouTube, and Medium.  Look for tutorials that focus on specific use cases that interest you, such as building a chatbot or a question-answering system.\\n\\n**3. GitHub Repository:** Explore the LangChain GitHub repository.  You can find the source code, contribute to the project, and see how different components are implemented.  Reading the code can be a great way to deepen your understanding.\\n\\n**4. Example Projects:**  The LangChain documentation and GitHub repository contain many example projects.  Start by running and modifying these examples to understand how different parts of the framework work together.  Try to break them, see what happens, and learn from the errors.\\n\\n**5. Community and Forums:** Engage with the LangChain community.  Ask questions on forums like Stack Overflow or join the LangChain Discord server (if one exists).  Learning from others\\' experiences and getting help when you\\'re stuck is invaluable.\\n\\n**6. Courses (Future Possibility):** While there aren\\'t many dedicated LangChain courses yet, as the framework is relatively new, you might find relevant courses on broader topics like large language models (LLMs) or building AI applications.  These courses might include sections on LangChain or provide a foundation that makes learning LangChain easier.\\n\\n\\n**To effectively learn LangChain, consider these steps:**\\n\\n* **Start with the basics:**  Understand the core concepts of LangChain, such as chains, indexes, agents, and memory.\\n* **Focus on a specific use case:**  Don\\'t try to learn everything at once.  Choose a project that interests you and focus on learning the relevant parts of LangChain.\\n* **Practice regularly:**  The best way to learn is by doing.  Build small projects and gradually increase their complexity.\\n* **Don\\'t be afraid to experiment:**  Try different approaches and see what works best.\\n* **Seek help when needed:**  Don\\'t hesitate to ask for help from the community.\\n\\n\\nBy combining these resources and approaches, you\\'ll be well on your way to mastering LangChain.
